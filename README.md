# pytest-imports

*A pythonic derivative of [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org), in the form of a [pytest](https://www.pytest.org) plugin.*

The idea is to write automated tests for the architecture aspects of your Python project.

For now, this plugin covers import statements in your Python code. This enables you to write automated tests for the dependencies in your project.

### Simple example
```python
from pytest_imports import must_import, must_not_import

def test_imports(imports):
    imports.check({
        'foo': must_import('bar'),
        'baz': must_not_import('qux'),
    })
```
This checks that module `foo` imports `bar`, and that module `baz` does not import `qux`.

Both `must_import` and `must_not_import` are inclusive with regards to substructures
(i.e., if there is an import of `foo.foo2` in a subpackage `bar.bar2` then the rule is satisfied).

### Installation & use

Install `pytest-imports` via the Python package manager of your choice (e.g., pip or uv).

If your project structure is "normal" then you can simply start using the `imports` fixture in your tests right away, as seen above.

### Complex examples
Import paths are always specified as fully qualified absolute paths (using `.` as separator).

```python
from pytest_imports import must_import, must_not_import, scope

def test_layered_architecture(imports):
    imports.check({
        scope('myapp', without='api'): must_not_import('myapp.api'),
        'myapp.api':                   must_import('myapp.core'),
    })
```
`scope('myapp', without='api')` covers all of `myapp` except the `myapp.api` subpackage. Pass a list to exclude multiple subpackages: `without=['api', 'adapters']`.

```python
def test_no_relative_imports_in_public_api(imports):
    imports.check({
        scope('myapp.api'): must_not_import('myapp', via='relative'),
    })
```
Via the `via` argument you can restrict a rule to only absolute (`via='absolute'`) or only relative (`via='relative'`) imports. Omitting `via` matches both.

```python
def test_multiple_rules_per_scope(imports):
    imports.check({
        scope('myapp', without=['adapters']): [
            must_not_import('sqlalchemy'),
            must_not_import('flask'),
        ],
    })
```
A list of predicates can be used to apply multiple rules to the same scope. All failures are reported together rather than stopping at the first violation.

```python
from pytest_imports import must_not_import_private, project

def test_no_private_imports(imports):
    imports.check({
        project(): must_not_import_private(),
    })
```
`must_not_import_private()` checks that no module imports a private symbol — any name starting with `_` or `__`, except the standard `__future__` module. `project()` is a special scope covering all modules in the project, useful for rules that apply globally. You can restrict to a specific package with `must_not_import_private('myapp')`.

```python
from pytest_imports import must_not_import_within_parent, project

def test_intra_package_imports_are_relative(imports):
    imports.check({
        project(): must_not_import_within_parent(via='absolute'),
    })
```
`must_not_import_within_parent(via='absolute')` checks that no module uses an absolute import to import from its own (immediate parent) package. For example, if `myapp.core.bbb` imports `myapp.core.aaa`, it must use `from .aaa import ...` rather than `from myapp.core.aaa import ...`. The `via` argument is required: use `via='absolute'` to enforce relative imports for intra-package dependencies, or `via='relative'` to enforce the opposite.

Note: This is similar to ruff's [TID252 (relative-imports)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/relative-imports/#relative-imports-tid252) rule, but works in the opposite direction — TID252 bans relative imports in favor of absolute ones, while `must_not_import_within_parent(via='absolute')` bans absolute intra-package imports in favor of relative ones.

## Details

### How it works

This plugin uses the `ast` module from the standard library to analyze the abstract syntax tree of your project. Import statements are collected and normalized when the `imports` fixture is first used in a test session.

The analysis is superficial, so there are limitations. Due to the dynamic nature of Python it is easy to circumvent tests if you want to. So we assume that this plugin is used in a "friendly" context.

Note that we don't track how the imported symbols are used. For example, in the case of
```python
import a
...
a.b()
```
you will *not* be able to check that `a.b` is used (e.g., via `must_import('a.b')`).

### Absolute vs. relative imports

Import paths in rules are always specified as fully qualified absolute paths, regardless of whether relative imports are used in the source. You can optionally use the `via` argument to distinguish between absolute and relative imports.

Note that relative imports from outside the configured project source directory are not supported (because we can't normalize those).

### Internal vs. external imports

Both imports from inside your project and from external packages (standard library or installed packages) are supported.

### Configuration

This plugin uses a simple heuristic to determine the source root of your project. You can check the source root via the `imports_project_paths` fixture in a test.

Alternatively you can specify the source root in the pytest configuration. If you use a `pyproject.toml` then this looks like:
```
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
    imports_project_paths = [
        "foo/bar",
    ]
```
With pytest 9.0+ you can also use the native TOML table:
```
[tool.pytest]
    imports_project_paths = [
        "foo/bar",
    ]
```
Other config formats are supported as well, as long as they are supported by pytest.

### Future plans

- Possibly add more architecture aspects, beyond imports.
- Optimize the implementation with regards to speed.
